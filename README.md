# LectureSlides_HighSpeedPCBDesign
This repository is an archieve of slides and videos that I have developed for a course entitled "High-speed PCB design" for the period from 2004 to 2013.
There are some video files that accompany the slides from Part 1 to Part 3.  These are mostly in Microsoft's AVI format.
